# ServerAdmin Scripts
Some scripts to help administer vHosts on a Debian System. They are tailored for fcgi, each with its own config. Adjust to your needs.

## Usage
1. Place everything into /etc/apache2/scripts/ (location doesn't matter)
2. Add Group "web" to your system (addgroup web)
3. Start adding webusers + vhosts with addwebuser + addvhost - they will tell you what to type
4. Have fun
